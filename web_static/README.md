# AirBnB clone - Web static

The goal of this project is to create a simple static web application that mimics the design of the AirBnB website, with no functionality or dynamic content.

First step is to create simple HTML static pages, defining the structure and elements that make up the content of the page.
After setting up the HTML structure, we will move on to styling the pages using CSS.
